        <h2>More about me</h2>
        <p>
            In 2014 I completed the master's programme Linguistics at Utrecht University. Shortly after that
            I started working at various companies and expanded my knowledge about (online) marketing.<br>
            <br>
            Since 2019 I work freelance (best decision so far! :-)) and help companies with (online) marketing,
            communication and copywriting.<br>
            <br>
            As I'm very interested in the online world, I want to expand my knowledge in web development as well. So
            here I am, taking this bootcamp at Codaisseur. I'm joining the first 5 days, to learn more about
            JavaScript.<br>
            <br>

        <h2>In my spare time</h2>
        <p>In my spare time I enjoy visiting concerts, going to the theatre or having a drink with friends. You can
            also find me listening to a podcast or reading a book.</p>
